;; 1 flymake-elisp-config: Setup `load-path' for flymake on Emacs Lisp mode
;; ========================================================================

;;   Default `load-path' for flymake on Emacs Lisp mode can be set through
;;   `elisp-flymake-byte-compile-load-path', but it is just a global
;;   variable.  When you are editing init.el, flymake should use all the
;;   `load-path'.  When you update some packages, `load-path' also should
;;   be updated.  When you are editing your package, flymake should use
;;   paths provided by cask or keg.

;;   This package provides three features:
;;   - Customizable variable `flymake-elisp-config-load-path-getter', which
;;     is a `FUNCTION' returning `load-path' for flymake.
;;   - Automatic setting of `load-path' for flymake by
;;     `flymake-elisp-config-auto-mode'.
;;   - Manual setting of it by configurers named
;;     `flymake-elisp-config-as-*'.


;; 2 How to Use?
;; =============

;;   Just write in init.el:
;;   ,----
;;   | ;; Make `load-path' for flymake customizable through `flymake-elisp-config-load-path-getter'.
;;   | (flymake-elisp-config-global-mode)
;;   | ;; Automatically set `load-path' for flymake.
;;   | (flymake-elisp-config-auto-mode)
;;   `----

;;   If automatical setting is wrong, you can use
;;   `flymake-elisp-config-as-*' commands to change `load-path' for flymake
;;   manually.
;;   `flymake-elisp-config-as-config'
;;         Emacs configuration file such as init.el
;;   `flymake-elisp-config-as-keg'
;;         Emacs Lisp project managed by `keg'.
;;   `flymake-elisp-config-as-cask'
;;         Emacs Lisp project managed by `cask'.
;;   `flymake-elisp-config-as-eask'
;;         Emacs Lisp project managed by `eask'.
;;   `flymake-elisp-config-as-default'
;;         Default Emacs Lisp file.  It uses same `load-path' as default
;;         flymake.


;; 3 Add configurer
;; ================

;;   When you want to use another `load-path' getter, you can define
;;   `configurer'.  It can be achived by three steps:
;;   1. Define predicate
;;   2. Define configurer
;;   3. Register to `flymake-elisp-config-auto-configurer-alist'


;; 3.1 Define predicate
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

;;   Define predicate function, which takes `BUFFER' as an argument, and
;;   which return `non-nil' only when `flymake' should use your new
;;   configurer.


;; 3.2 Define configurer
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

;;   Define configurer function, which takes `BUFFER' as an argument, and
;;   which sets `flymake-elisp-config-load-path-getter' in `BUFFER'.

;;   The value of `flymake-elisp-config-load-path-getter' should be a
;;   function which takes `BUFFER' as an argument, and returns list of
;;   path, like `load-path', which is used by `flymake' on `BUFFER'.
